    <h2>What is PSOUPOCODE?</h2>
    <p>While mentoring people in JavaScript I realized a lot of coding tutorials could be better. They assume prior knowledge, gloss over important concepts while focusing on rarely used ones (I have used a switch statement maybe once in the last year) and while they give a good foundation for working with coding they have some holes. PSOUPOCODE is my attempt to write tutorials that make sense and teach concepts in the correct order.</p>
